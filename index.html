Toxic free radicals are also produced naturally in the body during respiration.</strong></p><p><strong>The body is ingenious in the way it defends us, and it naturally, produces compounds called antioxidants that are capable of neutralizing toxic free radicals. The most powerful antioxidant produced in the body is called Co-enzyme Q10 (Co-enzyme Q10). Every organ in the body produces CoQ10, especially hard working organs such as the heart, brain, and liver. Studies show that low levels of CoQ10 cause chronic diseases of the heart and arteries.</strong></p><p><strong>In addition to fighting toxic free radicals, CoQ10 is the most important nutrient for generating energy in the body.

The idea that there is ‘good or bad cholesterol’ is also false. The so-called Good and Bad cholesterol are referring to transporters of cholesterol.

Cholesterol is an essential requirement for maintaining the brain, nerves, hormonal system, immune system and many other vital functions of the body.</strong></p><p><strong>The reality is that there is no known medical record of death caused by high cholesterol.
