  Inflammation is the hidden cause of heart disease. Inflammation is like a
  wound or injury that occurs inside the body. Unlike our outer skin that is
  tough and designed to withstand harsh environments, our internal organs are
  delicate and easily damaged by the toxic chemicals from our environment, as
  well as those produced inside the body.

**Inflammation is the hidden cause of heart disease. Inflammation is like a wound or injury that occurs inside the body. Unlike our outer skin that is tough and designed to withstand harsh environments, our internal organs are delicate and easily damaged by the toxic chemicals from our environment, as well as those produced inside the body.**

**Scientists have confirmed that the underlying cause of inflammation in the heart and blood vessels is highly toxic compounds called free radicals. These toxic free radicals enter the body when we come in contact with the vast array of toxic chemical compounds that pervade our environment today, from cleaning products, cosmetics, plastics, insecticides, herbicides, processed foods, and even medications. Toxic free radicals are also produced naturally in the body during respiration.**

**The body is ingenious in the way it defends us, and it naturally, produces compounds called antioxidants that are capable of neutralizing toxic free radicals. The most powerful antioxidant produced in the body is called Co-enzyme Q10 (Co-enzyme Q10). Every organ in the body produces CoQ10, especially hard working organs such as the heart, brain, and liver. Studies show that low levels of CoQ10 cause chronic diseases of the heart and arteries.**

**In addition to fighting toxic free radicals, CoQ10 is the most important nutrient for generating energy in the body. CoQ10 is known as the ' energy currency' of the body. Low levels of CoQ10 in the body is a major cause of tiredness today.**

**A leading contributor to Low CoQ10 is medications such as statins prescribed to lower cholesterol. Statin drugs halt the production of CoQ10\. For this reason, many health experts are of the opinion that statin drugs should be banned. Cholesterol-lowering drugs cause many problems like Tiredness, Memory loss, Depression, Muscle pain, Irregular heartbeat, and High blood pressure.**

**Contrary to popular belief, high cholesterol is not the cause of heart disease. The idea that there is 'good or bad cholesterol' is also false. The so-called Good and Bad cholesterol are referring to transporters of cholesterol. Good cholesterol carries cholesterol from the arteries to the liver, while Bad cholesterol carries cholesterol from the liver to the arteries. Both are important for the body. Cholesterol is an essential requirement for maintaining the brain, nerves, hormonal system, immune system and many other vital functions of the body.**

**The reality is that there is no known medical record of death caused by high cholesterol. People worried about high cholesterol can take natural supplements that control cholesterol without side effects such as policosanol and nicotinamide.**

**If you must continue to take statin drugs for lowering cholesterol, you should also take Coq10 supplements. Many doctors will never prescribe statins without CoQ10 supplements. The manufacturers of statins recommend that those taking statins must also take a CoQ10 supplement to prevent complications. However, no one should take statin drugs to lower cholesterol.**

**The most advanced and effective form of CoQ10 supplement is called MitoQ.**

**MitoQ is over 800 times more powerful than ordinary CoQ10 supplements. Many studies show that MitoQ is effective for preventing and treating diseases of the heart.**
